This run worked well for me. 

1.I started in town - kill the elderly men in the NE corner of town sometimes they pop an oct. 
2. kill the elderly man 2s of n.gate. 
3. Kill all the female citizens - i can't tell which one of them regularly pops 
4. The lady 2sw of Northgate pops a tri occasionally 
Then, 
The kobold in the SE corner of school - i never popped anything off the other mobs. 
Then, 
After the school run to Newbatia Downside 
1. the invisible dwarf regularly popped tris 
2. The weather witch occasionally did 
3. The elf under the mage guild occasionally popped 
After Downside move to the chessboard 
1. White king regularly popped 
2. Raging moose regularly popped 
3. Black king regularly popped 
After Chess board move to Tiger Glen 
1. The first purple butterfly regularly popped 
2. The tiger next to the thicket in the NW corner reguarly pops 
3. The hermit sometimes pops 
Recall 
Go to Daar tempest 
It seems completely random, but usually i'd pop 2 tokens killing everything in daar. 

By this time, the elderly men repopped and i started over. I'm sure you could reorganize the run to correlate to what order the areas repop. 
anyway i gathered about 50 tokens in 5 days. 

not that this helped my stats or anything.

The goblins in the mines (all e all n &d from recall) seem to drop atleast one tri-token everytime I clear them out.
