Some of the lower levels on Valk aren't too difficult to solo, depending on your
classo and knowledge, but as you get up in levels, odds are that you'll want to
group. Among the many reasons for this, it's simply easier to specialize and
take advantage of everyone's various strengths than to try to do everything
yourself. Also, with a well formed group, you actually eliminate the need to
regen and get more xp per mob than you could get on your own, and in a shorter
time.

Lately, I haven't seen a shortage of leaders, but I have seen a lot of newbies
who aren't familiar with what's needed in a group. This will try to go over the
basics.

2-man groups:

Stab/blast - These are some of the most fun, and deadly. Focus is on doing lots
and lots of damage as quickly as possible. Typically one will lead with stab or
grip and the other will blast immediately. Requirements are a stabber and a
blaster. The stabber will typically have high thief or monk levels, and some
combination of double stab, poison, focus, kensai, etc. The blaster will have a
high damage blasting spell such as firewind, or frostbolt. Area knowledge is key
or you'll look like a penny on a railroad track.

Blast/blast - Variation of stab/blast with 2 mana types. Can also be fun.

Tank/tank - Very old school method... This falls into the bigger is better
category. Basically, two tanks smash on the same thing. When one is getting
close to death, he drops protect and the other rescues and protects him. Both
must have decent armor class for this to work. It's also helpful, but not always
required for the one in back to be able to either deal a lot of damage, use
debuffing spells like curse and blind, heal, or all of the above.

Tank/debuffer - My personal favorite, but very hard to 2-man. Tank is usually a
warrior-type, but can actually be any classo as long as they have low AC and
protect, a whiner and rescue script are also very helpful. Debuffer usually has
blind at a minimum, but ideally has curse/damn, blind/acid blast, sanc/aegis,
web, weaken, cure/heal/restore, infuse and pretty much any other spell that can
be useful in battle. Disengage is also handy for reblinds and resancs. The
debuffer actually does the brunt of the work and a good one can make for a very
successful group. Also, it helps if the debuffer is a manabag since masterfuls
are determined by the total number of casting levels. BTW, these are also some
of the most underappreciated chars in the game... and some of the most talented.

Larger groups

Most larger groups are just extensions of the above. A stab/blast or blast/blast
can add as many blasters as necessary... killing power goes up. Tank/tank group
get bigger with more tanks, but this almost never happens since it's not a very
practical group and will normally switch over to a tank/debuffer with more
followers. So the rest of this will just explain how to run a large group.

If you're running an xp or equipment group, this is most likely the kind of
group you'll have. I'll try to outline the elements needed and how they should
fit.

Leader - Hopefully you. There's no real requirement for who leads, though
hopefully it's someone who knows what your group is capable of and the area
you're running. If the leader sucks, chances are the group will as well, since
it's VERY difficult to overcome a poor leader. This person is generally
reposible for deciding who does what, navigating, setting targets, watching the
healo's mana, and fixing anything that goes wrong.

Tank - Easiest job going. Needs a low AC. Figure -5 to -7 by level 20, -8 by
level 40, -9 by 2x40 and -10 by 3x40. It helps to have a tank that's on their
toes, but it's really not required if they have a whiner and a rescue script.
Why? Because if anything goes wrong, it's their job to stand there and die
first.... so it helps to be suicidal.

Healo - This can make or break a lot of groups. I've had to call quite a few
groups because I just couldn't get the mana I needed to run. Main job is to keep
the tank alive and lit.... and maybe raise if something goes wrong. Good friends
to have.

Goto - This is a term I kind of made up, but I think it's important to outline
it here. A lot of things happen in a group. Among them, different blind times,
sanc times, and different debuffing requirements for mobs. The goto is the
person I usually assign to keep things working. They're responsible for
relighting the tank, reblinding mobs, silence if it's needed, etc. ie. If it
needs to be fixed, I goto them to do it. Blind and sanctuary are pretty much
requirements. Disengage is very handy, silence, dispel magic, curse/damn, and
anything else useful is very nice. I generally keep them at the bottom of the
group so they don't get sucked into battle as much, they're last on the healo,
and they're pretty much the most important member of the group. This person may
be the healo, and sometimes the leader, but almost never the tank.

Optional:

Necros - Weaken is a great spell. Wall of flesh can be very handy. Infusions can
come in very handy when things suddenly go wrong. Jujus and other summons can
come in very handy if you're missing some of the other elements of the group...
like hitters and debuffers. Not strictly required for a group... but very very
handy.

Hitters - Depending on the size of the mobs you're taking, hitters become
important. Since the tank is probably parrying and mana types hit poorly and
have few attacks, you need someone to damage the mobs. Monks and warriors are
generally the best since they have lots of attacks, lots of damage and low AC.
They will also normally double as 2.tanks and 3.tanks depending on the size of
the mob and their AC.

Blasters - If you're fighting an ether mob or have a mob fully debuffed and he's
still pounding the tank, you need to do as much damage as fast as you can.
Nothing beats a mage. Also helpful for taking out summoned helpers during
battle. And when they're not blasting, they're useful for dispeling casting
mobs, debuffing, silencing, healing.... etc.

Bards - If you've got a lot of hitters in the group, nothing beats a bard for
speeding a group up. Brother in Arms/Valor can make stabs/grips land more often,
Gods of War can turn mobs into mincemeat, Dreams of the Castle can cut regen
times, Psalm of Disciple can help keep the tank alive and Cry of the Avatars can
make a lot of problems go away.

Stabber/Gripper - Depending on the mob, these can be handy. Nothing beats a
thief for outright damage. Combined with deathblow and bards, you can cut a lot
of mobs to shreds very quickly. Thieves are also handy for searching for caches
and disarming those pesky traps. Grippers don't do quite as much damage but they
do hold the mob in place for a while and, more importantly, lower the mobs
hitroll. There's a lot of mobs whose hitroll is high enough that they must be
completely debuffed before they stop pounding the tank. If this is the case, I
will almost always lead with grip so I have some protection while the mob is
being blinded. Properly used, it's a lifesaving tactic.

Typically, your group will be setup like this:

Leader is leading 'Group (Open)' on Sloth:
(Xx x.xx) Leader
(Wa x.xx) Tank
(Wa x.xx) 2.Tank/Hitter (optional)
(Th x.xx) 3.Tank/Hitter/Stabber/Gripper (optional)
(Xx x.xx) Necro/Bard/Hitter (optional)
...more Necro/Bard/Hitters...
(Cl x.xx) Healo
...more Healos...
(Ma x.xx) Blasters (optional, may double as Healos)
...more Blasters...
(Xx x.xx) Goto
(Xx x.xx) Non-Protectors (if any)

The main requirements for determining this list will be armor class, though you
may move folks around based on their jobs and abilities. When battle starts, you
don't want to have people tripping over each other, so it's normally best to
have certain jobs assigned. ie.

Before battle starts:
Protects - Make sure everyone is protected
Tank - Let people know who to heal
Healo - Heals are expensive, avoid overhealing, keep tank alive
Stabber/Gripper - You only get one opening move, make it count
Curse/Damner - Expensive spells, only cast once, Damn better than Curse
Webber - Will normally be tank, also expensive
Sanc/Wall/Aegiser - Try to keep out of healo... very expensive spells
Blinders - This will normally be everyone in the group
Dispeller - For casting mobs. So that you don't dispel debuffs
Silencer - For casting mobs. Keeps them from healing blinds/blasting
Staffer - Things go wrong. Make sure you have someone to handle it.

After battle starts, you may need these:
Reblinder - Blind only lasts 2 or 3 ticks, battle can be much more
Resancer/Waller - Sanctuary only lasts 3 ticks, battle can be much more
Goto - Things happen, have someone designated to hand it

Once you have the elements you need, things usually run pretty smoothly as long
as you pick the right targets and use the right tactics. The most important
thing after the group gets started is to watch the healo's mana. When it's gone,
you're done. This is why the healo is critical to the group, it's exactly like
gas. When you run out, your group is going nowhere fast.

Other considerations:
I hate to close groups... but it's not hard to get a group that's bigger than
the area you're running. If you don't know an area to move to, or haven't got
something you need to run that area (ie. you have a -9 instead of -10 tank),
then allowing the group to grow really defeats the purpose. Close the group or
see if they're willing to help you explore a new area.

Keeping an eye on the who list is always a good idea until you've got enough
folks to run smoothly. It's always handy to recruit better tanks, more healos,
more hitters or any other element you feel you're weak on.

I think that covers most the basics....

Most of all, have fun

****************************************************************

Very nice post. One thing that I disagree with is your ordering of class

I usually order this way

(Xx x.xx) Leader
(Wa x.xx) Tank
(Wa x.xx) 2.Tank/Hitter (optional)
(Mo x.xx) Gripper (optional)
(Th x.xx) Thief/Bard/Stabber/Hitter (optional)
(Ma x.xx) Blasters (optional, may double as Healos)
...more Blasters...
(Cl x.xx) Healo
...more Healos
(Ne x.xx) Necros for weaken and scourge debuffs
(Xx x.xx) Goto
(Xx x.xx) Non-Protectors (if any)

Here is my reasoning. Monks after warriors due to high dmg reduction / hp / ac /
dmg. Monks can take hits alot better than thieves can etc. Mages love to blast
on stab, if they are below the healos then clerics get drug into the fight and
sometimes hurt. Healo dying first is very bad. I put the most valuable debuffers
at the bottom of the group. This is usually necros because they have the variety
of debuffing spells and need to assist last. Alot of clerics dont have weaken so
they usually jump in the fight after blinds. Druids are very good in last viable
position due to high mana regen which makes them great goto chars.

In most of my groups the order is wa mo th ba ma cl ne dr.

Obviously situations vary and you may need to place chars according to other
skills.

PS Grats to all the new leaders I have seen lately, keep up the good work.

****************************************************************

Aye, this was mostly intended to cover the basics, but those are good points. I
also forgot some things, such as how to handle weakening and silencing, and
general order of debuffing.

For protect orders, I tend to consider AC first. So, for instance, Brady has
sometimes 2.tanked for me in a pinch because he can manage a -10 mode. I usually
have him run in mana mode which puts him at +AC and working in the goto. Necros
tend to have decent AC for a mana class, which usually places them higher... but
freedom to weaken is a very good consideration. Another perk of monks, besides
damage reduction is counterattack. While not quite as effective as parry, it
does give them a slight defense advantage, even over non-parrying warriors.

On the topic of goto. Any quad caster makes a fantastic goto simply for the
masterfuls and freedom of movement at the bottom of the protect order. Druid
primes have excellent outdoor regen, which makes characters like Daedalus and
Cipha powerhouses in the goto position. However, even 2nd druids with protect
such as Rynquald can handle themselves very effectively.

Mages are a tough case. They love to blast. In stab/blast groups, that works
great, but against larger mobs it's simply draining. I normally have them
refrain from blasting and concentrate on debuffing and healing unless their
cleric levels are low enough to make them ineffective healers. Since damners
normally have disengage, the tank webs, and everyone (including the healo) is
blinding, I typically don't have problems with the healo being dragged into
battle, and rarely with weakeners. Though typically necros are skilled enough
it's not really a problem. It's also very rare that it takes me more than 2-3
rounds to have a mob completely debuffed.

Lastly, these are only my opinions. I don't run the same as many leaders,
including Mike, and I know first hand that Mike knows exactly what he's doing.
If the folks following you are happy with the xp or equipment they're getting,
chances are, you're doing things right. Even better, if you have people asking
you to lead, you've got things mostly figured out.

On the other hand, if folks are dying/shocking on a regular basis from things
other than specs... this guide may be for you. Remember, just because a mob is
in an area doesn't mean you have to run it. There are a lot of mobs in a lot of
areas that simply not worth the trouble of killing. Paraclesus in the castle
comes to mind... Use your best judgment.
