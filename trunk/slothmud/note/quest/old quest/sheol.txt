You ask Vyutak, the deathmaster about power.
Vyutak, the deathmaster tells you 'I have created the ultimate golem,
one that lives off the energy of departed spirits.  However, my
calculations proved faulty.  The jewel that I chose to supply power to my
creation was not strong enough to sustain it.  It is already necessary to
replenish the power supply.'

Vyutak, the deathmaster tells you 'The jewel I first chose to power
my construct was too weak.  However, I have heard of a jewel as black as
night that imbues one with the strength of several men.  Bring me this
fabled jewel so that I can replinish the power of my creation.'
