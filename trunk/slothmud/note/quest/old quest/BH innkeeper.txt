The Innkeeper tells you 'Search the insane asylum and rid it of the unwanted roaches.  Your job will be complete when
you can bring me back one the head of the queen.  How do you tell a queen roach from the
others?  That's not so easy, but it can be done if you study the head hard enough.  The head
of the queen is slightly bigger and more bulky then the normal roach.  Good luck on your
quest, and I hope you are the right person to help fight the roach infestation before it
ends up all over town.  Say, while you are there, feel free to explore the rest of the
wonderful asylum.  It will help kill time while waiting for those roaches to pop their
heads back out.
