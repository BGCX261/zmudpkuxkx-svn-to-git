A fat constable tells you 'Seek out and find the hiding place of the gang of thugs that have been recently
harassing the town folk.  Seek and destroy the leader of this evil gang in an
effort to help bring law back to our peaceful town.  Upon bringing his dead body
to me, I will reward you fairly.  Good luck, and you might see if he has a way
to access the hidden chamber where the rumored chest of treasures lie in hiding.
Hurry now, you only have one day (24 real minutes) before I revoke your chance
to complete this quest for good.'
