me much more then a few slices bread and some water every couple days.  Go now and
bring me some real food, before I decide to start gnawing on you.

you're creating that diversion, we can steal the knowledge we need.  Why

The Borealic Tavern
   Tonight the tavern is full of dregs of society.  Everyone is standing
around, wrapped in ragged clothes or the occasional furskin of one of the
indiginous creatures that lurk just outside the camp's boundaries.  The
drinks are plentiful, and there is a band set up in the corner, trying to
manage strange looking instruments, but simply add to the ruckus.  There is
a bar off to the left, with a pretty nasty looking barkeep blocking a latched
door where many lowlifes of this society seem to be lured.

A burly man, the bartender is very muscular and powerful, yet there is a
distinct layer of fat hiding much of his muscle tone.  His shirt is covered
with stains from spilled drinks, some crimson stains from unruly patrons, and
even a few stains from a drunkard's vomit.  He seems very interested in the
stories that the people tell him, yet his eyes are always on the look for the
imminent spark of trouble.
The Barkeep is a member of the races of man.
