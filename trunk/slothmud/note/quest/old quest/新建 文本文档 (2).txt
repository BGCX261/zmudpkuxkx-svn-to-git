sits against the north wall.  On the altar stands a small statue of a naked

barrel into a trough that circles the altar and flows down glass tubes
lining the structure's legs.  Two granite columns jut up on either side of
the altar.  They rise up into the ceiling overhead.  The waist and legs of
a human body lie prone against the western wall.  The west wall itself
shimmers slightly in the torch light.
