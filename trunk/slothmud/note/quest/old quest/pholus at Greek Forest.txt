Pholus tells you 'Well it seems you are out of luck!  Someone has beaten you to the jug of sacred red
juices.  Oh you say you are here to help hey, not steal?  We to prove yourself, find
and return the sacred jug of wine to me at once.  Only then can I trust you, as you
have asked.  Who stole the wine you wonder?  Well all I know is he was drunk, very
drunk.  He also was of my own people, but we have yet to find this traitor.  All
the Centaur's knew just how sacred this wine was, and we never figured any of them
would steal it.  Maybe if you ask around among my people and ask about the wine,
someone can point you in the right direction.
