Original forge instructions:
Frnalzum makes the phylactery. It is a perfectly cubicle box, made of 
leather, with leather straps to tie it to the arms. A few letters are 
embossed on the outermost face of the box. Therefore, the objects required 
by Frnalzum to assemble the object are: 
A golden embossing stamp, a bone needle (to sew it all together), a 
leather plaque (to serve as the backing for the box), some silken thread, 
a bit of gypsum dust to preserve the leather, a rolled up piece of paper 
with a prayer written on it, a box of clean leather, and the leather thongs 
that are used to attach it to the arm.
