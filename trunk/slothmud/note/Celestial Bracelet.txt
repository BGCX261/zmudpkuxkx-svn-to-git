Original forge instructions:
The papyrus the scroll was created from is extremely fragile. The ink, 
although dim, is still quite legible. It appears to be a list of some 
sort. A chunk of marble, a crystal star, a bead and a gem. Use the 
marble as a base, infused with the amber bead. Place the gem in the 
most powerful position, so the star can feed off the energy. Remember 
to string it in the correct order, lest it will explode.
